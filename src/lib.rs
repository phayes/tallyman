//! Tallystick is a rust library for tallying votes.
//!
//! ## Compatibility
//!
//! Tallystick works with both nightly and stable rust, but more functionality is enabled on nightly. Tally methods that must be run with nightly rust are tagged `nightly`.
//!
//! To enable nightly support, add `features=["nightly"]` to your `Cargo.toml` entry for `tallystick`.
//!

/// and the candidate who polls the most among their counterparts (a plurality) is elected. It may be called
/// first-past-the-post (FPTP), single-choice voting, simple plurality, or relative/simple majority.
///
/// # Example
/// ```
///    use tallystick::plurality::DefaultPluralityTally;
///
///    // Election between Alice, Bob, and Cir with two winners.
///    let mut tally = DefaultPluralityTally::new(2);

/// candidates. The winner is the most-approved candidate.

/// Under STV, a voter has a single vote that is initially allocated to their most preferred candidate. Votes are totalled and a quota
/// (the number of votes required to win) derived. If a candidate achieves quota, the candidate is elected and any surplus vote
/// is transferred to other candidates in proportion to the voters' stated preferences. If no candidate achieves quota,
/// the bottom candidate is eliminated with votes being transferred to other candidates as determined by the voters' stated preferences.
/// These elections, eliminations, and vote transfers continue in rounds until the correct number of candidates are elected.

/// Requires the `nightly` feature to be enabled

/// The method can also be used to create a sorted list of winners.
/// The Schulze method is also known as Schwartz Sequential dropping (SSD), cloneproof Schwartz sequential dropping (CSSD), the beatpath method, beatpath winner, path voting, and path winner.
///
/// The Schulze method is a Condorcet method, which means that if there is a candidate who is preferred by a majority over every other candidate in pairwise comparisons, then this candidate will be the winner when the Schulze method is applied.

/// The Borda count determines the winner by giving each candidate, for each ballot, a number of points corresponding to the number of candidates ranked lower.
/// Once all votes have been counted the candidate with the most points is the winner.

/// # Example
/// ```
///    use tallystick::borda::DefaultBordaTally;
///    use tallystick::borda::Variant;
///
///    // Election between Alice, Bob, and Carlos with two winners.
///    let mut tally = DefaultBordaTally::new(2, Variant::Borda);
